            <p>
              Melbourne, Australia, is a place I've always dreamed of living in.
              I want to go there, experience the good weather, the beautiful
              environment, and a great work-life balance. Many times, I've
              wanted to make this dream happen, but I've had to put it on hold
              because of various obstacles. However, I once met a Malaysian
              person who told me,{" "}
              <span className="italic bg-indigo-200">
                "You have to go, whether itâ€™s to study or to live in Australia.
                I hope you get the chance to go at least once. It can help you
                grow and develop yourself.' If you have the chance, I truly hope
                you go."
